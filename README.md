# ScreenPDF

ScreenPDF is a library for easy screenplay generation under Python,
using PyFPDF as base (see [PyFPDF][1] \[1]).  
ScreenPDF uses [Moreno's how to write a screenplay][2] \[2] as reference
for proper screenplay format.

## How to run

Executing `python3 script_converter.py -f full-example.spdf` into the
Terminal generates the `right time.pdf` file.

You can write your own script following the `full-example.spdf` syntax.
